# Langgraph : 

Langchain is great, you just need to follow its documentation…

If you are an AI Engineer I’m sure you have suffered this before.

LangChain has gained lot of popularity for prototyping agents. But when you move into production… reality hits hard.

Here’s what I’ve seen again and again with devs trying to ship LangChain-powered agents:

🔹 Too many abstractions
Agent → AgentExecutor → ZeroShotAgent → ConversationalAgent. Great for slides, terrible for debugging. Developers spend hours digging through black boxes to find why a prompt broke.

🔹 Performance & cost overhead
Cold starts in serverless = painful. Extra layers = extra latency. One RAG query costs 2.7× more tokens with LangChain vs manual implementation. At scale, that’s $$$.

🔹 Memory & resource headaches
From leaks to 10GB RAM consumption on simple RAG systems. Cleanup patterns? Barely documented.

🔹 Breaking changes every week
~67% of “minor updates” break something. Teams spend more time chasing updates than building features.

🔹 Production ≠ Documentation
Almost 90% of production apps avoid official LangChain patterns. Built-in memory, LCEL, LangGraph? Most teams roll their own.

👉 That’s why the smartest AI engineers now treat LangChain as a utility library and build orchestration themselves. Others are moving to other toolings as well…

Bottom line: LangChain is amazing for prototyping, but production at scale is a different game!
