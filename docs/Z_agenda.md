## Meeting Notes: LangGraph Implementation (Forward Deployed Engineer) 

### I. What we discussed in the Meeting

Core Topics Covered
1. LangGraph Open Source Library Best Practices
	•	Best practices for production implementation	
	•	Common pitfalls and how to avoid them	
	•	Performance optimization strategies

2. Platform Usage for Multi-Agent Architectures
	•	Explicit usage patterns for LangGraph Platform	
	•	Multi-agent deployment and orchestration strategies	
	•	Development workflow optimization

3. Evaluation and CI/CD Integration
	•	Rapid iteration methodologies	
	•	Continuous evaluation frameworks	
	•	Integration with existing development pipelines

Main Concerns addressed: Routing + Intent Classification

Critical Finding: Routing coupled with evaluation iterations are IMPORTANT and MANDATORY for building solid systems.

Techniques to Improve Routing Accuracy:
	•	Structured outputs + reasoning + fallbacks to bigger models	
	•	Iterative evaluation and context engineering	
	•	Simple and straightforward evaluation platform with LangSmith	•	guardrail nodes (noting this adds latency)

Action Items from Meeting
	•	@MARCO will kindly share his notebook with the team	
	•	Request: Example of a production-ready system deployed at a client (if possible)

### II. What We Are Thinking, Going Forward.

Our possible routing strategy:

1. Implementation Approach:
	•	Clarification loops with the orchestrator main agent
	•	"Interrupt" capability for human-in-the-loop during routing (straightforward in LangGraph + Platform)
	•	Sub-agent handoffs - subagents can still hand off to other agents when considering sub-routing
	•	Guardrail NODES (noting this adds latency)	
	•	Fine-tuning classifiers as last resort if precision targets aren't met
	•	UX design considerations - UI elements to help classification (e.g., switch on/off buttons to trigger "costly"/long running deep research)

Note : 
The handoffs between Agents - Clarification loops - Escalations are "native" and quite easy in LangGraph.
LangGraph Platform adds simplicity as it persists the checkpoints, allows to easily resume a running agent in the middle  if that agent requests user intervention / or if we define human in the loop or an action w/ interruption 

2. Philosophy : Evaluation-Driven Development (EDD) for Agents

Core Philosophy:
Developing agents is about developing systems. Prompts are only a small portion of the overall system.

EDD Process:
	1.	Define datasets with comprehensive test cases	
	2.	Define evaluations with clear success metrics	
	3.	Iterate on prompts + logic and monitor accuracy improvements	4.	Implement CI/CD rules with evaluation gates

Advanced Optimization:
Once datasets mature with sufficient use cases, we can:
	•	Fine-tune models using libraries like DSPy	
	•	Potentially leveraging the coming prompt tuner that Marco mentioned	
	•	Scale evaluation across more complex scenarios

3. Next Steps Summary

	0. Access to the infrastructure (LangSmith, LangGraph Platform, etc.)
	1.	Set up initial routing prototype with clarification loops	
	2.	Implement evaluation framework with LangSmith integration	
	3.	Define initial datasets and success metrics	
	4.	Establish CI/CD pipeline with evaluation gates	
	5.	Design UX components for routing assistance
Meeting Date: 8 September 2025
Follow-up: Awaiting Marco's notebook and production examples
