## Sprint Overview

### SPRINT 1 - Foundation Architecture
**Objective**: Establish robust architectural patterns

**Epic Priorities**:
- Design Pattern 1: Conversation Loop (core orchestration)
- Design Pattern 2: Tool Node (reusable components)
- End-to-End Tracing Setup (LangGraph Platform dependency !!! )
- ElasticSearch Data Connector (leverage recent index discovery) 
 --> Ideally oriented for toolUsage
 --> Exploratioon of ElasticSearch MCP Server - found only Docker support for now :( - no npx/uvx for on-the-fly installation)

**Deliverables**: Documented architecture patterns, functional ElasticSearch connector to be used ideally by Agents

### SPRINT 2 - Multi-Agent Integration
**Objective**: Demonstrate impressive orchestration for September 25 milestone

**Epic Priorities**:
- Clarification Workflow Agent (complete implementation)
- "Quick" React Agent Design Pattern beta - Kubernetes (business context integration) [Only for DEMO 25/09]
- Supervisor Pattern (intelligent routing)
- Deploy Agents Easily in LGP + Consume them (LGP dependency!!!)
- Offline Evaluation Setup (LangGraph Platform dependency!!! - But would be so good )

**Deliverables**: Robust Agent, first K8S Agent deployed in LGP

### SPRINT 3 - React Agent Patterns
**Objective**: Implement robust and reusable React Agent designs

**Epic Priorities**:
- React Agent Design Pattern sub-epic - Approach 1 (ToolNode + Conditional)
- Prompt Engineering Phase 1 (best practices and templates)
- Platform Integration - followup (migration-ready architecture)
- - Offline Evaluation Setup follow-up (LangGraph Platform dependency!!! - But would be so good )

**Deliverables**: Standardized React patterns, Running Experiments for Offline Evaluation for K8S Agent

### SPRINT 4 - Advanced Orchestration
**Objective**: Platform integration and advanced agent patterns

**Epic Priorities**:
- React Agent Design Pattern - Approach 2 (AgentNodes + Concurrency)
- Agent Deployment Framework (LGP dependency)
- Prompt Engineering Phase 2 (dynamic runtime + LangSmith)
- Online Evaluation (production monitoring ... LGP dependency!!!)

**Deliverables**: Advanced agent patterns, deployment capabilities for K8S Agent 

### SPRINT 5  - Multi-domain Orchestration
**Objective**: Extend to additional troubleshooting domains

**Epic Priorities**:
- Epic : Context Engineering - Context Poisoning ( Mitigate Hallucination ) +  Context Compaction/Compression (Trimming/Summarizing of data) + Context Confusion 
- Epic : Design Pattern 2 :  Orchestrator Node - Supervisor mode - Concatenate responses + delegate to specialized summary agent ?
- Multi-Agent Advanced Orchestration (supervisor only handoff/Tool Hand offs/A2A Protocol)

**Deliverables**: Domain-specific agents, advanced coordination patterns for K8S Agent
