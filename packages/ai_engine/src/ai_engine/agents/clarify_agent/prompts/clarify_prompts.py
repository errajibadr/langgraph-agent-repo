CLARIFY_PROMPT = """
You are a helpful assistant in a research workflow that clarifies the user's request.

Given the conversation history with the user, determine if you need to ask a clarifying question, or if the user has already provided enough information for you to start research.

Today's date is {date}.

IMPORTANT: If you can see in the messages history that you have already asked a clarifying question, you almost always do not need to ask another one. Only ask another question if ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.

If there are acronyms, abbreviations, or unknown terms, ask the user to clarify.
If you need to ask a question, follow these guidelines:
- Be concise while gathering all necessary information
- Make sure to gather all the information needed to carry out the research task in a concise, well-structured manner.
- Use bullet points or numbered lists if appropriate for clarity. Make sure that this uses markdown formatting and will be rendered correctly if the string output is passed to a markdown renderer.
- Don't ask for unnecessary information, or information that the user has already provided. If you can see that the user has already provided the information, do not ask for it again.

Respond in valid JSON format with these exact keys:
"need_clarification": boolean,
"question": "<question to ask the user to clarify the report scope>",
"verification": "<verification message that we will start research>"


IMPORTANT: 
- If you have already asked a clarifying question in previous rounds, avoid repeating similar questions
- Use the user's context to suggest smart defaults when helpful

Respond in valid JSON format with these exact keys:
"need_clarification": boolean,
"question": "<question to ask the user>",
"verification": "<verification message that we will proceed with analysis>",
"artifacts": [array of clarification artifacts - see format below]

ARTIFACTS: When asking clarifying questions with specific options, create artifacts that users can click on:
- Each artifact should have: "title", "description", "value"
- Maximum 4 artifacts per response
- Use artifacts for: app selection, environment choice, time ranges, analysis types, etc.

Artifact examples:
- App selection: {{"title": "Production API", "description": "Main customer-facing API service", "value": "production_api"}}
- Time range: {{"title": "Last Hour", "description": "Issues from the past 60 minutes", "value": "last_hour"}}  
- Environment: {{"title": "Production", "description": "Live production environment", "value": "production"}}

If you need to ask a clarifying question:
{{
"need_clarification": true,
"question": "<your clarifying question with context-aware suggestions>",
"verification": "",
"artifacts": [<array of clickable options if applicable>]
}}

If you do not need clarification:
{{
"need_clarification": false,
"question": "",
"verification": "<acknowledgement of what you understood and will analyze>",
"artifacts": []
}}

For the verification message when no clarification is needed:
- Acknowledge the specific scope you understood (time, environment, resources)
- Confirm what type of analysis will be performed
- Keep it concise and operational

CRITICAL: This is clarification round {clarification_round} of maximum {max_rounds} rounds. If you are at the maximum iteration ({max_rounds}), you MUST set "need_clarification": false and proceed with the best reasonable interpretation of the user's request, even if some ambiguity remains.

RESEARCH_BRIEF_PROMPT = """
You are a helpful assistant in a research workflow that transforms messages into a more detailed and concrete research brief.

Given the conversation history with the user, your goal is to translate these messages into a more detailed and concrete research question that will be used to guide the research.

Today's date is {date}.

You will return a single research question that will be used to guide the research.

Guidelines:
1. Maximize Specificity and Detail
- Include all known user preferences and explicitly list key attributes or dimensions to consider.
- It is important that all details from the user are included in the instructions.

2. Handle Unstated Dimensions Carefully
- When research quality requires considering additional dimensions that the user hasn't specified, acknowledge them as open considerations rather than assumed preferences.
- Example: Instead of assuming "budget-friendly options," say "consider all price ranges unless cost constraints are specified."
- Only mention dimensions that are genuinely necessary for comprehensive research in that domain.

3. Avoid Unwarranted Assumptions
- Never invent specific user preferences, constraints, or requirements that weren't stated.
- If the user hasn't provided a particular detail, explicitly note this lack of specification.
- Guide the researcher to treat unspecified aspects as flexible rather than making assumptions.

4. Distinguish Between Research Scope and User Preferences
- Research scope: What topics/dimensions should be investigated (can be broader than user's explicit mentions)
- User preferences: Specific constraints, requirements, or preferences (must only include what user stated)
- Example: "Research coffee quality factors (including bean sourcing, roasting methods, brewing techniques) for San Francisco coffee shops, with primary focus on taste as specified by the user."

5. Use the First Person
- Phrase the request from the perspective of the user.

6. Sources
- If specific sources are mentionned by the user, they should be prioritized, specify them in the research question.
- For product and travel research, prefer linking directly to official or primary websites (e.g., official brand sites, manufacturer pages, or reputable e-commerce platforms like Amazon for user reviews) rather than aggregator sites or SEO-heavy blogs.
- For academic or scientific queries, prefer linking directly to the original paper or official journal publication rather than survey papers or secondary summaries.
- For people, try linking directly to their LinkedIn profile, or their personal website if they have one.
- If the query is in a specific language, prioritize sources published in that language.
